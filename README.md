erfa_python
===========

This is a Python wrapper for ERFA, Essential Routines for 
Fundamental Astronomy, a library derived and 'freed' from SOFA,
Standards of Fundamental Astronomy.

SOFA : http://www.iausofa.org

-----------
requirements
-----------

to use this wrapper, you need:

* Python 2.7 - 3.6

* C compiler to build the module.

  . newer version of gcc (4.7+) is prefered.

***********
download tarball
***********

latest version is available from Pypi:

    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/erfa_python

or from github:

    https://github.com/nirinA/erfa_python/releases

**********

------------
building
------------

* to build the module, unpack the tarball,
cd to ``erfa_python`` directory and do the usual:

```
    python setup.py build
```

note for OS X:
**************

* on OSX platform, it seems that ``erfa`` needs to be build as a library,
and some 'compatibility version' needs to be adjusted
thanks to @vhaasteren for reporting and solving this issue, see:

https://github.com/nirinA/erfa_python/issues/4

------------
installing
------------

* if previous version of erfa_python is already installed in ``site-packages``,
be sure to remove all related files before installing the new version.

* install (may need root privilege) with:

```
    python setup.py install
```

-------
testing
-------

a test-suite adapted from t_erfa_c.c is provided.
do:

```
    python erfa_test.py
```

to validate erfa_python module.

note:
*****
some test fail with older version of gcc (4.5).
thanks to @yanwang2012 for this report, see:

-------------
documentation
-------------

on-line documentation is available with:

```
    pydoc erfa
```

to generate a html version:

```
    pydoc -w erfa
```
    
and, from the interpreter:

```
   >>> help(erfa)
   >>> help(erfa.<function>)
```

C-api reference of liberfa is available in ``doc/api.rst``.
a html version can be built:

```
    cd doc   
    mkdir _build  
    sphinx-build . _build
```

you need ``sphinx`` and its dependencies to build the doc.
